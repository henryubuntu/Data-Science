# Data Science course

‚àÄ All code organized (of the topics I liked the most, ja ja ja ;) )

+ You can contact me at: enriquerios at mail.ru

+ You should take 30 minuts to 1 hour to relax a day watching tv, reading a book, playing videogames, or else to relax the mind of all the data science you will learn and be more relax your entire life, and remember, I told you.

+ Please, can you be eerily patient to learn all of this fast? -> ·µ¶‚Çë ·µ£·µ¢ùí∏‚Çï

+ Si vis fidelia, learn it, est is divitiae maxima, just remember and do, omnia in mensura et numero et pondere disposuisti.

+ Study (learn) and live your life on your own pace of time not of what is given by a company or institution or government, is suggested to solve your live and health problems first and then continue learning this course.

+ If you want all then:  https://youtu.be/pzehI8JRlwY 

+ Constancy and patience for this course is going to be rewarded.

+ Say no to death lines, say yes to successlines

+ Who wants to be a Data Science Unicorn? when with this you can be a Data Science Jinjo! ùìå‚Çë‚Çë‚Çë!

+ Is important that if whenever you are learning you are having a bad day, getting angry or some bad feeling stop programming for that day, relax and let it pass all the bad issues of the day and the next day continue, that way your emotion of anger will be smaller during your life and you will be able to control it whenever a situation of anger happens; because if you continue with the anger or the pain and start wanting to fixing things, many things will go wrong, is better all become nice and cool in life.

+ Always fresh water in your face and/or a shower will help you remember things more easily and find solutions

+ When you mix playing fast pace videogames non-played before or decades without playing it, learning a programming language from the basics to advance, eating well, having regular exercise and seeing fast pace animated movies or series non seen before or seen a lot of years ago in another language or in your own and that are really interested to the mind or very catchy, with a clear sound and graphics, and good health without a pain in any part of the body or any coming and going sickness, and avoid any psychological pressure from somebody to learn faster or someone who interrupts or bother or noisy talk, a peaceful environment without hearing any other sounds than what you make, with a clean and organized room and painted rooms with colors that enhance concentration, calm and fast calculated response and a bit more things. You learn fast to program, remember and whenever there is a mistake or error or system panic, you remain calm and remember your training and solve things faster. Magical things will happen to your brain if you do this for a year and continue doing it as a rutine.

¬∑ But of course, you can continue drinking soda, eating fast food with enough or either full of condiment or put the condiment like a side dish that when you put the condiment like ketchup or mayonnaise you do not leave any space of food without the condiment or a mix of the condiments, or whatever food that is either sweet or salty or high in fat and avoid at all cost any vegetables or just eat those that seem pretty, like painted oranges, or eat the sweetest fruits and vegetables only and avoid those that are a bit acid, or not eating enough or nothing some days or weeks, because you know "how much a human being can survive without food", yeah!, avoid doing any exercise, have a trash place with junk beside your bed and computer, get people always interrupting you by cellphone, online or direct communication, hearing any kind of not calm or music to concentrate, sometimes taking drugs to avoid the pain in your legs or other parts of your body for lack of excercise or taking them to enhance your brain, or drinks to increase your time to be awake or in a speed state, remain in the same place where people torment you psicologically, set the brightness of the TV or monitor to the fullest, solve your health problems for later and even avoid the dentist like the plague, avoid at all cost a research to the best updated material to learn on internet and just get the newest ones without properly checking the basics of it, not take care of your appearance and smell at all, just sleep for 4 hours or less everyday through a whole year, use the same dirty cloth over and over again, not clean your bed sheets ever, get angry by anything that boders you at all like all small mistakes and errors you find in the code of books or videolearning courses or ugly people or people that sometimes make ocasional without the intention mistakes that bothers you, do not do anything else besides studying or do things that you enjoy the most and study just some hours a day, and do not do anything else like exploiting your own talents like painting, writing music, playing an instrument and not showing them at all by any online media and instead get all the time you have collected to pass the tests of all the certification courses you have sign in, and besides seeing your favourite gore and xxx sites spend a lot of time playing an addictive videogame, avoid all unix or linux OS and download anything comes to your mind or recieve by email to your computer, smoke all you want and anything that you desire at any moment, when the moment comes that you feel pain in any part of your body disregard it every time and just focus on studying or just study some hours or some days anything at all, and just when becomes unbearable your pain for any afliction go to the hospital ER(instead of a visit to the doctor for a check up as I told you before) to have a cirgury, get meds for life and constant light-medium-hard pain forever, avoid reading any social or software developer's life manual, not have any rutine what so ever and improvise any day doing what craves you the most or whatever comes up, drink any alcohol whenever the crave comes up or just because, do not have any minute to relax during the day(just only when you sleep 4 hours or less), follow any super attractive advertisement you see anywhere from any brand and do what it tells you to consume or buy specially soda commercials or sweet food or fast food, I mean just let yourself and mind go and fall for anything that gives a pleasure comfort to the eyes, the ears and/or create a believe of social or family comfort specially, follow any trend or virual trend you can find and read all the time all those posts, let yourself go to any craving for sex to any girl/guy/genre you want and want you and specially unprotected sex because this is how your dick/vagina/ass/any extra genital/ feels the best, what I am talking about here is a total brain liberated functionality where you accept anything that your mind finds pleasurable or hits the sweet spot, like your predjuices to other people and ways to laugh and hurt people just because feels good to you and those jokes would be so awesome to hear to your peers and you would be the best joker ever for saying such jokes or demeanings to dump/old/minorities/children/poor people or countries(whereas being a white/black/red/tanned/brown or any other skin color of people e.g. Blue colored inbred people of Kentucky, USA[I do not know if there are still people like that there] and people like the Colloidal Silver self-medicated USA man, let your mind accept any social-familiar-biblical-religion-spiritual thing that people say to you and correspond by acceepting them and continue to proliferate such belivings just to avoid any discomfort of your mind to say "no" and feel a brain backlash of negativity to always seem happy and acceptable to anyone in your circle of faith-family-social group that makes you feel good by your oddities/cultural/common traits to you or to your group or community to belief to endorse/punish/avoid/respond with cold shoulder(instead of rational productive conversation).

$ The understanding of the topics will be more clear as you progress into the next book which will become easier to understand than the previous one, ergo no need to put a lot of effort to understand perfectly one book, because the next clarifies the ideas.

‚Ä¢ This plan is organized so you can exercise at least 1 hour a day, eat healthy food, avoid fluoride products to learn better, sleep well, have a clean environment, rest at least 1 day each week, days to get healthier when you get sick, etc, to remember more everything.

¬∑ At the last part of the course (not yet defined which part), you might need 2 hours to exercise a day, for better wellness.

¬∞ Any help to mantain and contribute to this project will be appreciated and acknowledged(if you want to). 

% This compilation is made also for those special people that are in our lives, they don't really need much money, need care, specially truthful love and protection.
