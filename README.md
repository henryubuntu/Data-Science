# Basic Data Science course

∀ All code organized (of the topics I liked the most, ja ja ja ;) )

+ To experience the high or the rush of cocaine with just a simulation (without taking cocaine or similar, just by playing and imagine is real money you are betting, I invite you to get rich in a simulated environment, and feel the high and the fall of your stock exchange empire

+ Many times, like 4, I ended with 0 money,sometimes in the street, sometimes with no food, once the food I got to eat for free in a park was fruit leftovers that nobody wanted anymore, so I eat it and was the only thing I ate in the day and drink water from the public park. 2 times I burned a bit my house to release my angers, so I suggest that instead you put throw water in your house to release the anger or wrath of your heart and release the big evil in you or to pray naked to god to know what to do and if you want to know more, contact me enriquemartinez at mail.ru or I suggest, if I may, to pray naked (we all humans of Earth arrived here naked) and ask god what to do to.

Wall Street Trader 2001

+ This a infallible course, so if you do not like some book to learn from or some code of a book is outdated you can use the others available.

+ You will use the computer mouse a lot so, to get more comfortable, buy a big HUGE computer mouse to give your hand a rest.

+ You should take 30 minuts to 1 hour to relax a day watching tv, reading a book, playing videogames, or else to relax the mind of all the data science you will learn and be more relax your entire life, and remember, I told you.

+ Study (learn) and live your life on your own pace of time not of what is given by a company or institution or government, is suggested to solve your life and health problems first and then continue learning this course.

+ You need to stay calm and relax and not go full on all the time learning, enjoy times of relaxation, because, once I had a huge craving or need or surge or wanting to eat german meat, I asked everyone about the german meat and everyone told me that they did not have the german meat, so I had to instead take other things to satisfy that craving and to relieve the craving by eating other things. I was a bit relaxed when I bought swiss cheese and the instructions were not so clear for me and I could not get the tools to get it right at Acapulco and many other things that made the cheese to not be so delicious as I was expecting, all that I ate that day did not fill me up, even I call the swiss chesse company to tell them that I was not satisfied the next day I think, then next day (meaning the day I called to the swiss cheese company) or 2 days I went to the big store (I do not want to say the famous name of this store for discretional purposes, though is big and famoues) and I did fidn the german meat, I was so furious that, that happen, that I wrote a letter to the suggestion box, that that made me so angry, thath I wanted to steal the meat because all the people of the big commercial store was not informed of the product and I was shure that I asked everyone. So, thats why I tell you, do not go learning quickly,the stamina of not finding mistakes and being also so smoothly fine all the code, makes you feel so trusted and proud to have learn well, on that you have learnt all the education materials fine and that, thats how life must be, PERFECT, smoothly pleasurably good and everything exact, and is NOT that way. That learnt perception by 1,2,3 or 4 years learning perfectly stays in your life and if you change your perspective to "lets make the world a perfect life for those who pays a fortune for doing data science mental brainwash on anyone and create concidences to make people have babies to get the best breed of the humans, even if the couple does not like each other, and only people who pays have sex with them without forcing to have sex with them, just by mental brainwash even pregnant women or exwife pregnant women, and/or expregnant women with their kids and keep them shut for ever with data science ads or anything else of mental data science brainwashing" maybe everytime that rains, is an earthquake, or any other thing that is out of the hands of the human being to fix, and you get mistakes in life or in code, you will be very furious and maybe lose your mind or be very perfectionist to downgrade other people for little mistakes they made and then being tagged as an aggry person or evil for respondig angrily little mistakes or make a little mistake and then feel  anger, agression, hate so much that becasue you never took time to relax between learning things, then or you want to nuclear the countries were they make tiny many mistakes with code, or kill your office coworksers or your boss or something very awful, kill your family or a cuttie puppy, a horse that looks like a unicorn, angrily kill an ant, or a female lion, a small lion, or smash a  or force your family have gang rape sex with friends to realease the anger or something that God see as forbidden if you have not earn it, maybe a person with mental disability no legs God gives him those heavenly gifts or a poor man that lost his fortune, and after 3 years of study recovers it, and his live is a dream of true love, family, money, and never need to hide use symbols to protect you from death.


+ No burn a law book stolen or in the missing and found place of a person, that person may be cursed with that ritual, I did in Preparatoria. I did it because I was super angry at a man that was super sadistic, scream all the time, take advantage of the people, was a rich boy with no compassion, though when I was charged to make a festival of the classroom, when I told them to do things, he did them and was very tender and no scream at my anymore. Those are the things you can avoid being calm and do not do rituals of revenge against kids that are bothering you or did in the past. After I did it, his skin became like white Michael Jackson and was the laugh of the classroom everytime someone said "Mooooo", because he had white spots like a cow.

+ If you want all then:  https://youtu.be/pzehI8JRlwY 

+ When I was a child, either by yelling me, or by punishing me or by hitting me with things or when I was younger-adult even then, a woman, I will not tell who, always, and according to her, did all those evil things to me, in her mind, to do something good and made me able to learn by the whip, till the day that I couldn't stand it longer, and I hit her in her ribs and yell so hard that stayed still like a rock and I was finally relieved from more than 30 years of not answering his evilness with evil, even though when she scratch me  with nails like claws when I was like 22 years old and all I did for that agression was to push her hard so she fall near the bed, without injuring her or hitting her head to the wall or ground, she landed above some boxes I think. So I studied hard all the time, maybe you will find more peace of mind by having this course of no mistakes(I made sure of that, so either the problem of the update of your computer or your OS or the difference between yours and mine,  and for this course, I hope that even though you will take 1 or 2 years to complete it, I hope you find always peace and avoid any sign of evil and never answer evil with evil in your life, not even if you are poor, sick, low height, brown of black skin or mentally ill, and you keep your feeling of vengance against women, any women, I mean the genre, that is, who has always being to me, very gossiper or inventing lies about me or making me feel hurt by releasing the evil feeling of "do not touch me" (which makes me always think "I have a lot of feeling now of killing her", well, not so much, but yes, hurting her, and I do not want her to say to anybody that I was the one who physically hurt her) so my best tactic could be to say "I do not want to talk to you and do not talk to me or I will call the police", is really a burning feeling in my heart that slash me any girl with the feel of blame, thats why I always invent tactics to avoid being hurt being physically or by my heart, and if her is who gets ashamed and blame me, by being a bitch, I  think God should kill her instantly.

+ Constancy and patience for this course is going to be rewarded.

+ Is important that if whenever you are learning you are having a bad day, getting angry or some bad feeling stop programming for that day, relax and let it pass all the bad issues of the day and the next day continue, that way your emotion of anger will be smaller during your life and you will be able to control it whenever a situation of anger happens; because if you continue with the anger or the pain and start wanting to fix things, many things will go wrong, because there is moment were anger blinds the mind and begin your 20 seconds of blackout, making you comport as the feeling lead you to your life end point were you did something bad and make it worst, so is better to do all nice, smooth, relaxed, have a cool life and respond evil with the divine justice of God, thinking, planing, being nice, avoid trouble, and many more tactics to avoid doing just evil to counterattack the evil, besides Satan, God did good things, for example he destroyed 2 cities, and if the Americans think they are lead by the Christianism and God, they exploded 2 atomic bombs to the small population of Japan.

+ Always fresh water in your face and/or a shower will help you remember things more easily and find solutions.

+ When you mix playing fast pace videogames non-played before or decades without playing it, learning a programming language from the basics to advance, eating well, having regular exercise and seeing fast pace animated movies or series non seen before or seen a lot of years ago in another language or in your own and that are really interesting to the mind or very catchy, with a clear sound and graphics, and good health without a pain in any part of the body or any coming and going sickness, and avoid any psychological pressure from somebody to learn faster or someone who interrupts or bother or noisy talk, a peaceful environment without hearing any other sounds than your own, with a clean and organized room and painted rooms with colors that enhance concentration and things as well, the color I suggest is this html code color #ffc000, and others for calm and fast calculated response of the brain and do other things with this and the other colors you selected, I will not reveal the secrets but what I can tip you about it. Ask the religion of your liking for their secrets or go to church and check there what are their secrets for mental control or how they make the people keep their attention, respect and even defending the church or the religion blindingly with their life.

+ You will learn faster to program, remember and whenever there is a mistake or error or system panic, you remain calm and remember your training and solve things faster. Magical things will happen to your brain if you do this for a year, and then for all your life.

$ The understanding of the topics will be more clear as you progress to the next book which will become easier to understand than the previous one, so, no need to put a lot of effort to understand perfectly one book, because the next clarifies the ideas.

· At the last part of the course (not yet defined which part), maybe after 3/4 or 3/5 of all the course, you might need 2 hours to exercise a day, for better wellness.

° Any help to mantain and contribute to this project will be appreciated and acknowledged(if you want to). 

% This compilation is made also for those special people that are in our lives, they don't really need much money, need care, special truthful love, calm (you know in the world were wars, natural disasters, etc, so remain calm and focus to resolve all better and faster) and protection.

+ I suggest also read some books of psicology or double meaning objects or optical tricks, etc, this will improve greatly your mind to resolve problems and look for other perspectives to find a solution. I suggest 1 month to learn, and no more time, to finish reading all you can or while you are learning the data science path. Trust me, you will find a greater advantage to have that knowledge against the other data scientists, and remember, I told you,  :)   =)  :]  ^-^   ^_^. 

❤️ Thanks to the next authors who with his books is achieved this compilation:
